# Tune It V1

## Summary
This is the first version of my last high school year final project. I will be doing a newer version of this app soon. The code was later ported to Android Studio so I could review some things for the second version.

## The idea
Tune It is a version of the popular `Draw Something` game but instead of drawing you have to sing. You start by selecting a song and you then send it to your opponent. If your opponent guesses the song you both earn points.

## Disclaimer
Please note:
- It was developed in 2013 when Android Studio still didn't exist.
- This was my first Android app so the code might not be completly performant nor nice
- At the time, dependency managment was not as easy as gradle makes it look nowadays.
