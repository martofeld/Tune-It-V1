# Tune It V1

This is the first version of my last high school year final project. I will be doing a newer version of this app soon. The code was later ported to Android Studio so I could review some things for the second version.

Please note:
- It was developed in 2013 when Android Studio still didn't exist.
- This was my first Android app so the code might not be completly performant nor nice
- At the time, dependency managment was not as easy as gradle makes it look nowadays.
